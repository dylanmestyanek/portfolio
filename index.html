							<p>I have always been an advocate of solving puzzling problems, producing unique designs, and pushing the limits of my creativity. Years spent in the restaurant industry taught me the organization, discipline, and effective communication, that I invest in my projects each day. Every spare moment over the past year, has been used to expand my knowledge of working with code, and contribute to my growth as a full stack developer.</p>

						  <p><strong><span><u>Challenges:</u></span></strong> The largest challenge faced during this project was my first interaction with speech recognition. The majority of the time was spent dissecting the response objects from the Speech Recognition API, and discovering ways to manipulate the text into commands for the application to respond to.</p>
						  <p><strong><span><u>What I learned:</u></span></strong> This project was one of the first functional JavaScript applications I worked on. It tested my creativity, as there wasn't a definitive guide to implement speech recognition into a timer application. During the construction of this project, I got my first taste of continuous Google research, and countless amounts of broken code. The experience of building this app taught me patience, persistence, and planning. Upon completing this app was when I realized there is not one specific way to achieve a solution in code.</p>

						  <p><strong><span><u>Description:</u></span></strong> Spotifier was a group project built to mimic the functionality of Spotify. Upon creating an account, the user is provided the option to look up songs from a library, save those songs to their user-specific playlist, and view 10 similar tracks related to that song (provided from our Data Scientists data model in the group).</p>
						  <p><strong><span><u>Challenges:</u></span></strong> Being my first group-oriented front-end project, it took some patience to comprehend "efficient routing". There was a lot of trial and error when it came to building out the application components, and how to implement a convenient user flow throughout the app.</p>
						  <p><strong><span><u>What I learned:</u></span></strong> This project taught me effective team communication and collaboration. There was a plethora of ideas shared amongst the team, so it took time to plan accordingly. We also agreed additional initial planning would have been a great benefit to the project. </p>

						  <p><strong><span><u>Description:</u></span></strong> This Weight Lifting Journal project is an API built that allows a front-end application to connect, and retrieve the user stored in the database and display their workout data. This API provides endpoints for all CRUD functionality the application may need to add information about their workouts and exercises.  </p>
						  <p><strong><span><u>Challenges:</u></span></strong> This was my first back-end group project, built with one other developer. The largest barrier we faced was planning an efficient database schema, and envisioning how our endpoints would be built through out project. We faced a handful of challenges when troubleshooting errors, and had to patiently test each endpoint.</p>
						  <p><strong><span><u>What I learned: </u></span></strong> Building a fully functioning API gave me a solid understanding how the front and back-end could connect together. It allowed me to pinpoint prior front-end errors I would receive, and helped me see the importance of informative, precise documentation for each endpoint. Additionally, I gained great appreciation for clear and concise API error handling. </p>
